Swingit is a tool, developed to detect correct hold in ballroom dancing. It automatically detects dancers' hips, shoulders, and elbows, and computes the angle between the torso and the arm. If the angle is below the adjustable treshold (70 degrees by default) the lines light up red and system classifies hold as incorrect. The counter in the upper left-hand corner, with green background, calculates the number of frames with incorrect hold for the left arm (L) and the right arm (R). The counter in the upper right-hand corner indicates the current framerate, while processing. Click the link to access demo.

Good Movement is an analysis tool for athletes and coaches. It helps to imagine the correct movement of a certain body part, by drawing "in space" a chosen point, among 32 available landmarks, detected by medipipe's pose estimation model. In this video Novak Djokovic's right wrist has been tracked, so it shows the correct backswing in his forehand.
